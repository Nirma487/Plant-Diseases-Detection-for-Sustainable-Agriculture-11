𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐒𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 :- Building a Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture Project with Python! 🌿🌱

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: building a plant detection basic application using Python!

This system allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf🍀, and using image 📷recognition techniques, it can detect the presence of various diseases such as blight, mildew, and more.


🗝𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝒊𝒏𝒗𝒐𝒍𝒗𝒆𝒅:-

📎𝘐𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘨:- Using PIL (Pillow) to load and preprocess images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

📎𝘔𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭 𝘉𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨:- Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.

📎𝘔𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨:- Training the model on a dataset of diseased and healthy plant images.

📎𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘭𝘪𝘵 𝘈𝘱𝘱 𝘋𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘱𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵:- Creating a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit to allow users to upload images and receive predictions.



🗝𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝒇𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒔 𝑰'𝒎 𝒂𝒊𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐 𝒊𝒏𝒄𝒍𝒖𝒅𝒆:-

📎𝘐𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘊𝘢𝘱𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦:- Users can take a photo of a plant.

📎𝘙𝘦𝘢𝘭-𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦 𝘈𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘺𝘴𝘪𝘴:- The application will process the image and provide an identification of the plant species.

📎𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘴:- The application will display the confidence level of the identification.

📎𝘈𝘥𝘥𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘐𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯:- The app will provide users with relevant information about the identified plant, such as its common and scientific names, native habitat, and care instructions.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to learn about image processing, machine learning, and Python. I'm eager to continue developing this application and explore its potential for further use cases.
